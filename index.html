  <p><img src="steptoebutte.jpg" alt="View">Steptoe Butte is a quartzite island jutting out of the silty loess of the <a class="tip" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palouse">Palouse<span>Learn more about the Palouse!</span></a> hills in Whitman County, Washington. The rock that forms the butte is over 400 million years old, in contrast with the 15-7 million year old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_River"> Columbia River</a> basalts that underlie the rest of the Palouse (such "islands" of ancient rock have come to be called buttes, a butte being defined as a small hill with a flat top, whose width at top does not exceed its height).</p>
